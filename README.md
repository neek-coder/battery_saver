# BatterySaver

A Flutter app developed for **LaunchHacks IV**, aimed at helping users preserve their phone batteries — and, by extension, reduce environmental impact caused by unnecessary battery degradation and waste.

## The Idea

Modern smartphones often drop to critically low battery levels by the evening. Many people resort to **overnight charging**, which can reduce battery health over time and increase long-term environmental harm due to battery replacement and disposal.

BatterySaver was built to solve a personal pain point:  
> "My phone always ran down to 1% by evening, but I didn’t want to leave it charging overnight — that’s not ideal."

## What the app does

- Monitors your phone’s **battery level in the background**
- Sends timely **reminders** when it’s a good time to plug in your device
- Lets you set a **target time** by which you'd like your phone to be fully charged (e.g., before bedtime)
- Helps reduce the need for risky overnight charging by encouraging smarter charge timing

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter** with Dart
- `workmanager` for background task execution
- `flutter_local_notifications` for notifications
- `shared_preferences` for lightweight data storage

## Impact

By encouraging healthier charging habits, BatterySaver can:
- Extend the lifespan of your phone battery
- Reduce the frequency of battery replacements
- Help minimize e-waste and battery-related pollution

## Development

This app is currently in development for Android.
